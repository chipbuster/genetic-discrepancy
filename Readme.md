Genetic Star Discrepancy
===============================

Testing repository for the Genetic Star Discrepancy algorithm.

Note: Since the test data is relatively small and self-contained (~250MB), I've chosen to include it in the repository proper.

Hey you dopes: if we ever plan to release this to public, we'll need to add GPL headers to all the source code files (see: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html)
