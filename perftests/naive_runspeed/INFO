Tests for runspeed of base naive code using built in timing flags
based on commit ff15845e6f5f7442ec1097e998234d9ac0d89bc8

KNL Compile command: icc -O3 -g -p star-discrepancy.cpp -o knl-discrep.x -xMIC-AVX512 -std=c++11 -I ../include -qopenmp
SB  Compile command: icc -O3 -g -p star-discrepancy.cpp -o sandy-discrep.x -xAVX -std=c++11 -I ../include -qopenmp

(need to load cxx11/4.9.1 to compile on sandybridge)

Steps to run:
  - Run build-bin-sb.sh from stampede-main and build-bin-knl.sh from stampede-knl
  - Run distribute-binaries.sh to distribute executables into appropriate directories
  - sbatch the sh file in each directory in the tests
       The script will run the analysis on the file in the directory for M= 1e3, 1e4, and 1e5 
       The program outputs will be stored in $M.out
       The stdouts (with timing info) will be in $M-stdout.log
       The total times (from time command) will be in the job output.
       gmon.out (for profiling info) will be for M=1e5.
